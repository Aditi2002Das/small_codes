        <h1 class="title1">Independence Day</h1>
            <p>On August 15, every year, India celebrates its Independence Day, which marks the event when it attained freedom from the British rule. Independence Day celebrations are centred in the national capital, Delhi, where the ceremonial National Flag hoisting takes place at Red Fort from where the Prime Minister delivers a speech to the entire nation. While celebrations spark up in almost every corner of the country, some of the historical landmarks where they truly come to life are worth a visit.</p>
        <h1 class="title2">Red Fort</h1>
        	<p>The Indian Prime Minister hoists the National Flag at the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Red Fort every year on Independence Day. As the Prime Minister arrives, he receives salutes from the three wings of the Defence Forces i.e. Army, Air Force, Navy and the Delhi Police. As the PM hoists the flag, 21 honorary gunshots are fired and the Indian National Anthem i.e. Jana Gana Mana is played. He then delivers a speech that reminisces the events leading up to the Independence and ends with a hopeful note about the country's future. As the day progresses, patriotic parades and pageants are held, along with performances by schoolchildren. It was at Red Fort that the first Prime Minister of India, Pt Jawaharlal Nehru delivered the first Independence Day speech in 1947.</p>
        <h1 class="title3">India Gate</h1>
        	<p>India Gate is a stunning archway and a landmark of Delhi. It is standing as a tribute to the brave soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the country. The walls of the gateway have been carved with the names of 13,516 soldiers killed in the Northwestern Frontier in the Afghan war of 1919, besides 90,000 soldiers of the Indian Army who were martyred in World War I. Amar Jawan Jyoti, made of marble, is located in front of India Gate and was constructed in the year 1971. It was built to pay tribute to the brave soldiers who lost their lives during the Indo-Pak War in December 1971. The flame is guarded by uniformed soldiers and a shining rifle crowned by an army helmet has also been kept near it.</p>
